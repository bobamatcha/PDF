## Common Questions

### "My signature looks shaky"

That is okay! Real signatures are never perfect. The important thing is that it is YOUR signature.

Try using larger strokes. You can also use the "Type" option instead.

### "I cannot see the signature box"

Scroll down the document. Some signature boxes are on page 2 or later.

Use the page navigation buttons to move through the document.

### "The document will not load"

- Check that the file is a PDF (ends in .pdf)
- Try refreshing the page
- Make sure the file is not password-protected

### "I signed the wrong place"

No problem. Look for an "Undo" or "Clear Signature" button. You can remove your signature and try again before downloading.

### "Where did my signed document go?"

Check your Downloads folder. It is usually named the same as the original file with "_signed" added.
