## 🎯 TAMPA DEMO PRIORITY (January 2026)

> **Goal:** Ship a comprehensive, featureful demo for Tampa Bay real estate meetups covering all three contract types: **Lease**, **Purchase**, and **Listing**.

### Research Foundation

Three comprehensive research documents have been created to guide implementation:

| Document | Coverage | Key Statutes |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| [FL_PURCHASE.md](./FL_PURCHASE.md) | Purchase contracts, condos, mobile homes, maritime | FAR/BAR, SB 264, F.S. 718.503, F.S. 319.261 |
| [FL_LEASE.md](./FL_LEASE.md) | Residential, commercial, mobile home park leases | Ch. 83 Pt I/II, Ch. 723, HB 1015, HB 621 |
| [FL_LIST.md](./FL_LIST.md) | Listing agreements, brokerage compliance | Ch. 475, NAR Settlement, F.S. 689.302 |

### Contract Type Priority Matrix

| Contract Type | Template | Status | Demo Priority |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Residential Lease** | `florida_lease.typ` | ✅ Exists (needs gaps filled) | P0 - Showcase |
| **Purchase - As-Is** | `florida_purchase_as_is.typ` | 🔴 Needs creation | P0 - Most common transaction |
| **Listing Agreement** | `florida_listing.typ` | 🔴 Needs creation | P0 - Brokers are the audience |

### Tampa Bay Metro Local Considerations

| Area | County | Key Local Issues | Implementation |
|------|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Tampa** | Hillsborough | MacDill AFB (SB 264 10-mile zone), CDDs (South Tampa, Brandon), Bayshore flood zones | Military proximity check, CDD addendum trigger |
| **St. Petersburg** | Pinellas | CCCL disclosures, aging condo stock (SIRS critical), barrier islands | Coastal property rider, enhanced condo safety |
| **Clearwater** | Pinellas | Beach regulations, height restrictions, short-term rental rules | Zoning disclosure addendum |
| **Wesley Chapel** | Pasco | Extensive CDDs, agricultural transitions, Scrub Jay habitat | CDD detection, environmental disclosure |

### Metro Detection Implementation

```typescript
// Efficient zip code → metro mapping (~15KB JSON)
const FL_ZIP_METRO = {
  // Tampa Bay (~600 zips)
  "33601": { metro: "Tampa", county: "Hillsborough" },
  "33701": { metro: "St. Petersburg", county: "Pinellas" },
  // Orlando (~400 zips)
  "32801": { metro: "Orlando", county: "Orange" },
  // Miami (~500 zips)
  "33101": { metro: "Miami", county: "Miami-Dade" },
  // Jacksonville (~300 zips)
  "32201": { metro: "Jacksonville", county: "Duval" },
};

// Critical infrastructure zones for SB 264
const MILITARY_BASES = [
  { name: "MacDill AFB", lat: 27.8492, lng: -82.5213, radius_miles: 10 },
  { name: "NAS Jacksonville", lat: 30.3867, lng: -81.6800, radius_miles: 10 },
  { name: "NS Mayport", lat: 30.3936, lng: -81.4183, radius_miles: 10 },
];
```

**Detection Priority:**
1. Zip code lookup (fastest, ~1ms)
2. Parcel ID prefix (Hillsborough = 19-XXXXX)
3. Geocode address (async, ~200ms, requires API)
4. Manual selection (fallback)

## 🌍 16-STATE COMPLIANCE ENGINE (Coming Soon Display)

The existing compliance engine supports 16 states with 227 tests. For the Tampa demo, display these as "Coming Soon":

```javascript
const STATE_STATUS = {
  available: {
    FL: { name: "Florida", tests: 31, templates: ["lease", "purchase", "listing"] }
  },
  coming_soon: {
    TX: { name: "Texas", tests: 15, eta: "Q2 2026" },
    CA: { name: "California", tests: 18, eta: "Q2 2026" },
    NY: { name: "New York", tests: 12, eta: "Q2 2026" },
    GA: { name: "Georgia", tests: 10, eta: "Q2 2026" },
    IL: { name: "Illinois", tests: 11, eta: "Q2 2026" },
    PA: { name: "Pennsylvania", tests: 8, eta: "Q3 2026" },
    NJ: { name: "New Jersey", tests: 9, eta: "Q3 2026" },
    VA: { name: "Virginia", tests: 8, eta: "Q3 2026" },
    MA: { name: "Massachusetts", tests: 7, eta: "Q3 2026" },
    OH: { name: "Ohio", tests: 6, eta: "Q3 2026" },
    MI: { name: "Michigan", tests: 7, eta: "Q3 2026" },
    WA: { name: "Washington", tests: 8, eta: "Q3 2026" },
    AZ: { name: "Arizona", tests: 6, eta: "Q3 2026" },
    NC: { name: "North Carolina", tests: 5, eta: "Q3 2026" },
    TN: { name: "Tennessee", tests: 5, eta: "Q3 2026" }
  }
};
```

**UI Treatment:**
- Florida: Green checkmark, fully clickable
- Others: Lock icon with state outline, "Coming Q2 2026" tooltip
- Clicking locked state shows: "Join waitlist for [State] launch notification"

---

## Quick Reference

| Domain | Purpose | Source Microservice | Priority |
|--------|---------|---------------------|----------|
| **agentPDF.org** | Compliance checking + template population | agentPDF-web + corpus-server | High |
| **getsignatures.org** | Standalone digital signatures | docsign-web | High |

**Goal:** Deploy simple working versions to both domains ASAP, then iterate.

**Strategic Context:** See [STRATEGY.md](./STRATEGY.md) for market positioning, vertical targeting, and go-to-market approach.

---

## 🚀 PRIORITY: Florida Compliance Features

> **Local-First Template Generation: ✅ COMPLETE** - Template rendering runs entirely in browser via WASM. Zero server cost per document.
>
> **Next Priority: Florida Regulatory Compliance** - The local-first architecture enables $0 marginal cost, which unlocks the "Free Local, Paid Cloud" business model. Now we need the Florida-specific features that create market urgency.

### Florida Regulatory Deadlines

| Feature | Statute | Priority | Status |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Email Consent Addendum** | HB 615 | SHORT-TERM | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Flood Disclosure Wizard** | SB 948 / § 83.512 | MEDIUM-TERM | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Tampa Landing Page** | Marketing | SHORT-TERM | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **Tampa Demo Script** | Marketing | SHORT-TERM | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **30-Day Termination Notice** | § 83.57 | SHORT-TERM | ⚠️ Template needs update |

### § 83.512 Flood Disclosure (MEDIUM-TERM PRIORITY) - ✅ COMPLETE

**Risk**: Landlords who fail to provide this disclosure can face:
- Tenant can terminate lease immediately
- Tenant can demand full rent refund
- Creates "voidability risk" for every lease that lacks this addendum

**Implementation**: Neutral tristate wizard that generates compliant form:

```
Step 1: "Property flooding history"          → [Yes] [No] [I don't know]
Step 2: "Flood insurance claims"             → [Yes] [No] [I don't know]
Step 3: "Federal flood assistance (FEMA)"    → [Yes] [No] [I don't know]
                                               ↓
                    [Generate § 83.512 Compliant Disclosure Form]
```

**Scrivener Adherence**: Per strict neutrality requirements, the wizard:
- Offers 3 options including "I don't know / Property recently acquired"
- Defaults to "I don't know" (doesn't lead user either way)
- Uses neutral phrasing without implying a "correct" answer
- Complies with form generation best practices for legal documents

### HB 615 Email Consent (SHORT-TERM PRIORITY) - ✅ COMPLETE

**Value Prop**: "Stop paying for Certified Mail. Get the free form to make Email Legal in Florida."

**Implementation**: The TENANT signs consent during signature ceremony (not pre-filled by landlord):

```
Template generates:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TENANT'S ELECTION (HB 615)                                    │
│  (Tenant: Please check ONE option below during signing)        │
│                                                                │
│  ☐ I CONSENT to receive notices via email                      │
│  ☐ I DECLINE and require postal mail                           │
│                                                                │
│  Email: [tenant@email.com]                                     │
│  Signature: ________________________                           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Scrivener Adherence**:
- Both options unchecked by default (tenant must actively choose)
- Tenant signs during getsignatures.org ceremony
- Not pre-filled by landlord in template form

---

## ✅ COMPLETE: Local-First Template Generation

### Architecture Change

```
BEFORE (Server-Side):
Browser → HTTP API → MCP Server (Typst) → PDF → Browser
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Server cost per request

AFTER (Local-First):
Browser → WASM (Typst) → PDF
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~
          $0 marginal cost, runs entirely client-side
```

### Implementation Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `compile_document_sync()` | ✅ Done | Sync version of Typst compilation for WASM |
| Feature flags (`server`/`wasm`) | ✅ Done | tokio optional via feature flag |
| `render_template()` WASM export | ✅ Done | Exposed in agentpdf-wasm |
| `render_typst()` WASM export | ✅ Done | Raw Typst source rendering |
| `list_templates()` WASM export | ✅ Done | Template discovery |
| `validate_typst_syntax()` WASM | ✅ Done | Syntax validation |

### WASM API (agentpdf-wasm)

```javascript
// Render embedded template to PDF (returns base64)
const pdfBase64 = wasm.render_template("florida_lease", JSON.stringify({
  landlord_name: "John Smith",
  tenant_name: "Jane Doe",
  property_address: "123 Main St, Miami, FL 33101",
  monthly_rent: "2000"
}));

// Render raw Typst source
const pdfBase64 = wasm.render_typst("Hello, *World*!", "{}");

// List available templates
const templates = JSON.parse(wasm.list_templates());

// Validate syntax before rendering
const errors = JSON.parse(wasm.validate_typst_syntax("#let x = "));
```

### Cost Comparison

| Model | Server Cost | UX |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Server-side (MCP) | Per-request | Fast first render |
| **Local-first (WASM)** | **$0** | ~20-40MB initial download, then instant |
| Hybrid (cache) | $0 after first load | Best of both worlds |

### Trade-offs

**WASM Bundle Size** (mitigated by lazy loading):
- Typst compiler: ~15-20 MB
- typst-assets fonts: ~25-30 MB
- Application code: ~2-3 MB
- **Total: ~45-55 MB** (lazy-loaded on first template render)

**Mitigation**: Compliance checking (small WASM) loads immediately. Template rendering (large) loads on-demand when user clicks "Generate".

### UI Integration

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Template selector modal | ✅ Done | Loads templates from WASM |
| Form generation | ✅ Done | Dynamic form from template fields |
| Local-first rendering | ✅ Done | Falls back to API if WASM unavailable |
| PDF viewer integration | ✅ Done | Generated PDF loads in viewer |

### Performance (Measured)

- **WASM bundle size**: 26 MB uncompressed, 8.3 MB brotli
- **Template render time**: ~650ms (florida_lease, 14 pages)
- **Server cost**: $0 per document

### Files Changed

- `crates/typst-engine/Cargo.toml` - Added `server`/`wasm` feature flags
- `crates/typst-engine/src/compiler/render.rs` - Added `compile_document_sync()`
- `crates/typst-engine/src/lib.rs` - Feature-gated exports
- `apps/agentpdf-web/wasm/src/lib.rs` - Added template rendering exports
- `apps/agentpdf-web/www/js/template-selector.js` - Local-first rendering logic
- `apps/agentpdf-web/www/index.html` - Template callback integration

### ✅ Quality Checks

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **cargo test --workspace --all-features** | ✅ 460+ tests passing |
| **cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings** | ✅ Clean |
| **cargo fmt --all -- --check** | ✅ Formatted |
| **WASM Compilation (agentpdf-wasm)** | ✅ Compiles (wasm-opt disabled) |

- **Single command**: `trunk serve www/index.html` builds WASM + serves with hot reload
- **Production build**: `trunk build www/index.html --release` outputs to `www/dist/`
- **No manual wasm-pack**: Trunk handles wasm-bindgen and bundling automatically
- **State data from Rust**: StateSelector now loads states + statute citations from WASM (no JS duplication)

### ⏸️ Blocked/Deferred

| Component | Status | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **corpus-core** | ⏸️ Blocked | Version conflicts between candle-core, rand, and half crates |
| **corpus-api** | ⏸️ Blocked | Depends on corpus-core |

**corpus-core Details:**
- Code uses `candle-core`, `candle-nn`, `tokenizers`, `hf-hub` for BGE-M3 embeddings
- Candle 0.8.x has compatibility issues with rand 0.9.x and half 2.7.x
- Options: (1) Wait for candle 0.9 stable release, (2) Rewrite with fastembed, (3) Use remote embedding API
- Not critical for MVP - semantic search is an advanced feature

### 📋 Next Steps (Post Phase 3) - UPDATED FOR LOCAL-FIRST PIVOT

## Phase 4: Nationwide Template Expansion

> **Full Research**: See [LEASE_RESEARCH.md](./LEASE_RESEARCH.md) for comprehensive legal analysis.

### Strategic Template Use Cases

| Use Case | Description | Priority | Research |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Residential Lease** | 50-state lease automation with compliance | High | [LEASE_RESEARCH.md](./LEASE_RESEARCH.md) |
| **Tax Preparation** | TurboTax competitor with IRS-compliant forms | High | [TAX_RESEARCH.md](./TAX_RESEARCH.md) |
| **Estate Planning** | Wills, trusts, POA with UPL-safe statutory forms | High | [ESTATE_RESEARCH.md](./ESTATE_RESEARCH.md) |
| **Commercial Lease** | Office, retail, industrial leases | Medium | - |
| **Property Management** | Notices, addendums, disclosures | Medium | - |

### The "Layer Cake" Architecture

Templates must support hierarchical compliance:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  VARIABLE LAYER - User inputs (rent, dates, parties)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LOCAL LAYER - City ordinances (Chicago RLTO, SF rent ctrl) │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  STATE LAYER - Statutory requirements (deposits, notices)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  FEDERAL LAYER - Lead paint, Fair Housing (baseline)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Rollout Strategy: Volume/Complexity Matrix

| Tier | States | Strategy | Status |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Tier 0** | FL | ✅ Complete (10 rules in compliance-engine) | ✅ 31 tests |
| **Tier 1: Big Five** | TX, CA, NY, GA, IL | High volume, prove platform capability | ✅ Complete (76 tests) |
| **Tier 2: Growth** | PA, NJ, VA, MA, OH, MI, WA, AZ, NC, TN | Regional importance | ✅ Complete (111 tests) |
| **Tier 3: URLTA Block** | AK, KS, KY, NE, NM, OR, RI + others | Clone master template | Pending |
| **Tier 4: Long Tail** | Remaining states | Complete coverage | Pending |

### Contract Verifier Engine

The `compliance-engine` crate will be extended for multi-state support:

```rust
// Current: Florida-specific rules
pub enum FloridaRule { SecurityDeposit, Notice3Day, ... }

// Future: Jurisdiction-based rules
pub struct JurisdictionRules {
    federal: Vec<FederalRule>,      // Lead paint, Fair Housing
    state: Vec<StateRule>,          // Statutory caps, notices
    local: Option<Vec<LocalRule>>,  // City ordinances
}
```

### Key Verifier Logic (Examples)

| State | Rule | Implementation |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **CA** | Deposit ≤ 1 month (AB 12) | `if deposit > rent { ERROR }` |
| **NY** | Late fee ≤ min($50, 5%) | `late_fee = min(50, rent * 0.05)` |
| **TX** | Lockout clause must be bold | PDF formatting check |
| **IL-Chicago** | RLTO Summary required | Zip code → attachment logic |
| **GA** | No "as-is" clauses (HB 404) | Regex scan for void terms |

### Legislative Compliance Notes

| Jurisdiction | Active Requirements |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Illinois | Landlord Retaliation Act, no e-payment mandate |
| California | SB 611 Junk Fee transparency, AB 12 deposit cap |
| Virginia | HB 2430 Fee disclosure on Page 1 |

## Phase 5: Tax Preparation Platform

> **Full Research**: See [TAX_RESEARCH.md](./TAX_RESEARCH.md) for comprehensive IRS compliance analysis.

### Tax Form Architecture

The tax product uses a hierarchical form structure similar to the Layer Cake:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FORM 1040 - Master Return (anchors all schedules)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  NUMBERED SCHEDULES (1, 2, 3) - Aggregate categories        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LETTERED SCHEDULES (A-SE) - Specific tax situations        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  WORKSHEETS - Intermediate calculations (not filed)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SOURCE DOCUMENTS - W-2, 1099s (import/display)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### IRS Compliance Requirements

| Publication | Purpose | Implementation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Pub 1167** | Substitute Forms Standards | PDF tolerances, font requirements |
| **Pub 1179** | Information Returns (1099s) | Copy B formatting for recipients |
| **MeF Schema** | XML e-file transmission | Schema validation, error codes |

### Form Priority Matrix

| Priority | Forms | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **P0: Core** | 1040, 1040-SR | Required for all returns |
| **P1: Income** | W-2, 1099-NEC, 1099-MISC | Gig economy, self-employed |
| **P2: Deductions** | Schedule C, SE | Sole proprietor focus |
| **P3: Itemized** | Schedule A, B, D | Investment income, itemizers |
| **P4: Complex** | Schedule E, K-1 | Rental, partnerships |

### State Tax Integration

| State | Forms | Complexity |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **California (FTB)** | 540, 540NR | Residency rules, AB5 worker classification |
| **New York** | IT-201, IT-203 | 2D barcode mandate, NYC resident credit |

## Phase 6: Estate Planning Platform

> **Full Research**: See [ESTATE_RESEARCH.md](./ESTATE_RESEARCH.md) for comprehensive UPL analysis and statutory form research.

### Market Context: The Great Wealth Transfer

The US is undergoing an unprecedented wealth transfer of **$16-84 trillion** from Baby Boomers to Gen X/Millennials. Traditional legal services fail the middle class due to prohibitive costs.

**Opportunity**: Statutory-compliant PDF builder operating in "safe harbor" of validity.

### The UPL Firewall

**Critical Risk**: Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL) is a crime in most states.

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Verbatim Input** | Software populates forms exactly as entered, no interpretation |
| **Statutory Forms** | Use state-promulgated forms, not proprietary instruments |
| **Scrivener Logic** | Present options for selection, never recommend |
| **Explicit Disclaimers** | Clear notice: not a lawyer, no legal advice |

**The Scrivener Doctrine**:
```
PROHIBITED (Advisory): "Based on your $5M assets, we recommend a Credit Shelter Trust"
PERMITTED (Scrivener): "Do you want a Credit Shelter Trust? [Tooltip: defined as...]"
```

### Tier 1 Markets (Big Four)

| State | Wealth Index | Primary Need | Statutory Forms Available |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **California** | 2.71 | Revocable Living Trusts (probate avoidance) | Probate Code § 6240, § 4701 |
| **New York** | 1.95 | Updated POA (2021 overhaul) | GOL § 5-1513 |
| **Texas** | 0.62 | Independent Administration Wills | Supreme Court approved forms |
| **Florida** | 0.33 | Advance Directives | F.S. Chapter 765 |

## Phase 7: Web Performance Benchmarking

> **Full Research**: See [BENCHMARKING_RESEARCH.md](./BENCHMARKING_RESEARCH.md) for comprehensive implementation guide.

### Overview

This phase introduces a SOTA (State-of-the-Art) web performance benchmarking harness built on `chromiumoxide` and Rust. The harness measures Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) and custom business metrics for Critical User Journeys (CUJs), integrating with the existing testing infrastructure.

### Why Benchmarking?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Performance regressions slip into production | Automated CI/CD quality gates with threshold enforcement |
| "It works on my machine" syndrome | Network/CPU throttling simulates real-world conditions |
| Single-metric blindness (just measuring "load time") | Multi-dimensional metrics: Loading, Interactivity, Visual Stability |
| Averages hide tail latency problems | Percentile-based assertions (P50, P95, P99) |

### Architecture: Parallel Browser Contexts

The benchmarking harness leverages `chromiumoxide`'s async architecture for high-throughput measurement:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      BENCHMARK ORCHESTRATOR                         │
│  - Reads benchmark.toml configuration                               │
│  - Spawns parallel browser contexts (not processes)                 │
│  - Aggregates results and computes statistics                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                     │
│  ┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐       │
│  │ Browser Context │ │ Browser Context │ │ Browser Context │ ...   │
│  │ (Iteration 1)   │ │ (Iteration 2)   │ │ (Iteration 3)   │       │
│  │                 │ │                 │ │                 │       │
│  │ - Isolated      │ │ - Isolated      │ │ - Isolated      │       │
│  │ - Fresh cache   │ │ - Fresh cache   │ │ - Fresh cache   │       │
│  │ - web-vitals.js │ │ - web-vitals.js │ │ - web-vitals.js │       │
│  └─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘       │
│                                                                     │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │                   SINGLE BROWSER PROCESS                     │   │
│  │  (Reused across all contexts for efficiency)                 │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight**: Unlike testing where parallelism is per-process, benchmarking uses **parallel Browser Contexts** within a single Chromium process. Context creation is ~50-100ms vs ~2-5s for process startup.

### Integration with Testing Infrastructure

The benchmarking harness builds on the existing `chromiumoxide`-based E2E testing:

| Component | Testing Use | Benchmarking Use |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Browser spawn | 1 per test file | 1 shared, many contexts |
| Context isolation | Test independence | Iteration isolation (cold cache) |
| CDP commands | Assertions | Metric collection + throttling |
| Page navigation | Verify UI state | Measure LCP, wait for NetworkIdle |
| Element interaction | Verify behavior | Measure INP, custom timings |

### Claude Code Subagent Delegation Strategy

The benchmarking implementation is well-suited for **parallel subagent delegation** due to its modular, independent components. Here's the optimal delegation plan:

#### Phase 7.1: Foundation (Parallel Subagents)

| Subagent | Task | Dependencies | Estimated Complexity |
|----------|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Agent A** | `benchmark-harness` crate scaffold + config.rs | None | Low |
| **Agent B** | `metrics/web_vitals.rs` - LCP, INP, CLS collection | None | Medium |
| **Agent C** | `throttling/` module - Network + CPU throttling | None | Low |
| **Agent D** | `stats/` module - Percentiles + Outlier detection | None | Medium |

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PARALLEL EXECUTION (Phase 7.1)                                     │
│                                                                     │
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐            │
│  │ Agent A  │  │ Agent B  │  │ Agent C  │  │ Agent D  │            │
│  │ Scaffold │  │ Metrics  │  │ Throttle │  │ Stats    │            │
│  └────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘            │
│       │             │             │             │                   │
│       └─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘                   │
│                           │                                         │
│                     MERGE POINT                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why Parallel**: These components have no code dependencies on each other. They only share types from `shared-types` which already exists.

#### Phase 7.2: Integration (Sequential)

| Step | Task | Depends On |
|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | `runner.rs` - Orchestrator that uses all modules | Phase 7.1 complete |
| 2 | `reporter/` - JSON + Console output | runner.rs |
| 3 | Integration tests with real scenarios | All above |

**Why Sequential**: The runner must integrate all the parallel work. This is a natural merge point.

#### Phase 7.3: CI/CD Integration (Parallel Subagents)

| Subagent | Task | Dependencies |
|----------|------|--------------|
| **Agent E** | GitHub Actions workflow for benchmarks | Phase 7.2 |
| **Agent F** | Benchmark scenarios for agentPDF.org | Phase 7.2 |
| **Agent G** | Benchmark scenarios for getsignatures.org | Phase 7.2 |

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PARALLEL EXECUTION (Phase 7.3)                                     │
│                                                                     │
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐                  │
│  │ Agent E  │  │   Agent F    │  │   Agent G    │                  │
│  │ CI/CD    │  │ agentPDF     │  │ docsign      │                  │
│  │ Workflow │  │ Scenarios    │  │ Scenarios    │                  │
│  └──────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why Parallel**: Each domain (CI config, agentPDF scenarios, docsign scenarios) is independent.

### Key Dependencies

```toml
# crates/benchmark-harness/Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
chromiumoxide = { version = "0.7", features = ["tokio-runtime"] }
tokio = { workspace = true }
serde = { workspace = true }
toml = "0.8"
statrs = "0.17"            # Statistical functions
average = "0.15"           # Online mean/variance
tracing = { workspace = true }

[dev-dependencies]
proptest = { workspace = true }
```

### Usage Examples

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# Run all benchmarks
cargo run -p benchmark-harness -- --config benchmarks/agentpdf.toml

# Run with specific throttling override
cargo run -p benchmark-harness -- --config benchmarks/docsign.toml --network slow4g --cpu 6

# Output JSON for CI
cargo run -p benchmark-harness -- --config benchmarks/all.toml --output json > results.json
```

**Programmatic Usage:**
```rust
use benchmark_harness::{BenchmarkRunner, Config};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let config = Config::from_file("benchmark.toml")?;
    let runner = BenchmarkRunner::new(config).await?;

    let results = runner.run_all().await?;

    // Check thresholds
    if results.lcp_p95 > config.thresholds.lcp_p95 {
        eprintln!("LCP P95 exceeded threshold!");
        std::process::exit(1);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Benchmark execution time | < 5 min for 30 iterations | Wall clock |
| Context startup overhead | < 100ms per context | Trace |
| Statistical significance | < 5% CoV for stable pages | Coefficient of Variation |
| CI integration | Zero false positives | Track over 100 runs |

### Relationship to Testing Infrastructure

The benchmarking harness **complements but does not replace** the existing E2E testing:

| Concern | E2E Tests | Benchmarks |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Question answered** | "Does it work?" | "Is it fast enough?" |
| **Failure mode** | Assertion failure | Threshold violation |
| **Parallelism** | Multiple browser processes | Multiple contexts in one process |
| **Isolation** | Full process isolation | Context isolation (cache, cookies) |
| **Frequency** | Every PR | Nightly + release |
| **Duration** | Seconds per test | Minutes per scenario (many iterations) |

Both systems share:
- `chromiumoxide` as the browser automation layer
- Scenario definitions (can share selectors)
- CI infrastructure (GitHub Actions)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Run benchmarks locally
cargo run -p benchmark-harness -- --config benchmarks/config.toml

# Run with verbose output
RUST_LOG=benchmark_harness=debug cargo run -p benchmark-harness

# Generate JSON report
cargo run -p benchmark-harness -- --output json > benchmark-results.json
```

### General Build Commands

```bash
# Full workspace check
cargo check --workspace

# Run all tests
cargo test --all-features --workspace

# Development servers (Trunk - recommended)
cd apps/agentpdf-web && trunk serve www/index.html --port 8080
cd apps/docsign-web && trunk serve www/index.html --port 8081

# Production builds (Trunk)
cd apps/agentpdf-web && trunk build www/index.html --release  # Output: www/dist/
cd apps/docsign-web && trunk build www/index.html --release   # Output: www/dist/
```

## 1. Executive Summary

This plan consolidates four microservices into a **modular monolith** using Cargo Workspaces, enabling:

1. **Code Reuse**: Extract ~25,000 lines of production Rust code
2. **Shared Components**: Common PDF handling, types, and utilities
3. **Dual Deployment**: Two independent web applications from one repository
4. **Test Preservation**: Maintain 150+ existing tests across all components
5. **ASAP Launch**: Phased approach prioritizing working deployments

### Key Principle: Prefer Existing Code

The microservices contain battle-tested implementations. This plan prioritizes **copying and adapting existing code** over rewriting:

| Component | Existing Code | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Florida compliance rules | agentPDF-web (90 tests) | Copy directly |
| PDF signing (PAdES) | docsign-web (63 tests) | Copy directly |
| Typst rendering | agentPDF-server | Copy directly |
| Semantic search | corpus-server | Copy directly |
| Coordinate transforms | docsign-web | Extract to shared |
| PDF parsing | Both web services | Unify into shared |

### Insights from Research

The [RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md) document provides architectural guidance. Key applicable ideas:

| Research Concept | Application |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Modular Monolith** | Use Cargo Workspaces for logical separation |
| **Shared Dependencies** | Unify tokio, serde, axum versions workspace-wide |
| **Local-First** | Preserve IndexedDB storage in web apps |
| **Type Safety** | Consider rspc for future Tauri desktop version |
| **Tantivy Integration** | Already implemented in corpus-server |

> **Note:** The research proposes a Tauri desktop app. For ASAP web deployment, we defer Tauri but preserve the architecture for future desktop builds.

### Insights from Strategy

The [STRATEGY.md](./STRATEGY.md) document provides market positioning and go-to-market guidance. Key strategic priorities that inform this plan:

| Strategic Priority | Implementation Impact | Timeline |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Florida RE Dogfooding** | Phase 0 targets Florida real estate agents & property managers | **Short-Term** |
| **Offline-First Competitive Moat** | Preserve existing local-first architecture in both apps | Short-Term |
| **Medical Mode** | Plan for HIPAA-compliant local encryption in docsign-web | Medium-Term |
| **Field Ops Mode** | Add GPS/photo evidence capture to getsignatures.org | Medium-Term |
| **MCP as AI Infrastructure** | Ensure mcp-server app is production-ready for enterprise | Medium-Term |
| **Government Micro-Purchase** | Keep annual pricing under $10K threshold | Long-Term |

> **Why Florida RE First:** The corpus already contains Florida residential lease templates. Targeting landlords and property managers first allows focused dogfooding before pivoting to other verticals. Regulatory pressure (§ 83.512, HB 615) creates natural market urgency.

## 4. Shared Components Strategy

### 4.1 Extraction Priority

Create shared crates **before** copying application code. This ensures proper dependency flow:

```
1. shared-types      (no deps on other crates)
2. shared-pdf        (depends on: shared-types)
3. shared-crypto     (depends on: shared-types)
4. compliance-engine (depends on: shared-types, shared-pdf)
5. corpus-core       (depends on: shared-types)
6. docsign-core      (depends on: shared-types, shared-pdf, shared-crypto)
7. typst-engine      (depends on: shared-types)
```

### 4.2 shared-types

**Purpose:** Common types used across all applications.

**Source Files:**
- `agentPDF-web/agentpdf/crates/agentpdf-core/src/types.rs`
- `corpus-server/corpus-core/src/document.rs`

**Unified Types:**
```rust
// crates/shared-types/src/lib.rs
pub struct Document {
    pub id: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub metadata: DocumentMetadata,
}

pub struct Violation {
    pub rule_id: String,
    pub statute: String,
    pub severity: Severity,
    pub message: String,
    pub position: Option<TextPosition>,
}

pub struct ComplianceReport {
    pub document_id: String,
    pub violations: Vec<Violation>,
    pub passed: usize,
    pub failed: usize,
    pub warnings: usize,
}

pub enum Severity {
    Critical,
    High,
    Medium,
    Warning,
    Info,
}
```

### 4.3 shared-pdf

**Purpose:** PDF parsing and coordinate transformation.

**Source Files:**
- `docsign-web/docsign-wasm/src/coords.rs` - DOM↔PDF mapping
- `docsign-web/docsign-wasm/src/pdf/parser.rs` - lopdf wrapper
- `agentPDF-web/agentpdf/crates/agentpdf-wasm/src/extraction/` - Text extraction

**Unified Interface:**
```rust
// crates/shared-pdf/src/lib.rs
pub trait PdfDocument {
    fn load(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<Self>;
    fn page_count(&self) -> usize;
    fn extract_text(&self, page: usize) -> Result<String>;
    fn get_dimensions(&self, page: usize) -> (f64, f64);
}

pub struct CoordinateTransform {
    // From docsign-web/coords.rs
    pub fn dom_to_pdf(&self, x: f64, y: f64) -> (f64, f64);
    pub fn pdf_to_dom(&self, x: f64, y: f64) -> (f64, f64);
}
```

### 4.4 shared-crypto

**Purpose:** Cryptographic primitives for signing.

**Source Files:**
- `docsign-web/docsign-wasm/src/crypto/keys.rs` - ECDSA P-256
- `docsign-web/docsign-wasm/src/crypto/cms.rs` - CMS/PKCS#7

**Interface:**
```rust
// crates/shared-crypto/src/lib.rs
pub trait SigningKey {
    fn sign(&self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;
    fn public_key(&self) -> &[u8];
}

pub struct EcdsaP256Key { /* from docsign-web */ }
pub struct CmsSignedData { /* from docsign-web */ }
```

### 4.5 compliance-engine

**Purpose:** Unified Florida Chapter 83 compliance checking.

**Source Files (to merge):**

| From agentPDF-server | From agentPDF-web | Combined |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------|
| RadonDisclosureRule | - | ✓ |

| - | AsIsStructural | ✓ |
| - | AttorneyFeeReciprocity | ✓ |
| - | NoticeRequirements | ✓ |
| - | MonthToMonthNotice | ✓ |
| AnomalyDetection | - | ✓ |

**Unified Engine:**
```rust
// crates/compliance-engine/src/lib.rs
pub struct UnifiedComplianceEngine {
    rules: Vec<Box<dyn ComplianceRule>>,
}

impl UnifiedComplianceEngine {
    pub fn florida() -> Self {
        Self {
            rules: vec![
                // From agentPDF-server
                Box::new(RadonDisclosureRule),
                Box::new(LeadPaintDisclosureRule),
                Box::new(BedBugDisclosureRule),
                Box::new(AnomalyDetectionRule),

                // From agentPDF-web (better implementations)
                Box::new(ProhibitedProvisionsRule),
                Box::new(SecurityDepositRule),  // Merged
                Box::new(AsIsStructuralRule),
                Box::new(AttorneyFeeRule),
                Box::new(NoticeRequirementsRule),

                Box::new(LateFeeRule),
                Box::new(GracePeriodRule),
            ],
        }
    }

    pub fn check(&self, text: &str) -> ComplianceReport { /* ... */ }
}
```

## 6. Migration Plan

### 6.1 Git History Preservation

Preserve commit history from all microservices:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/migrate-history.sh

# Initialize monolith if needed
cd /Users/amar/AG1337v2/BobaMatchSolutions/PDF/monolith

# Import each microservice with history
for service in agentPDF-server agentPDF-web corpus-server docsign-web; do
    echo "Importing $service..."

    # Add as remote
    git remote add $service ../microservices/$service
    git fetch $service

    # Merge with history preservation
    git merge $service/main --allow-unrelated-histories \
        -m "Import $service with full history"

    # Move to appropriate directory
    # (Manual restructuring follows)

    git remote remove $service
done
```

### 6.2 File Copy Script

#!/bin/bash
# scripts/copy-sources.sh

## 7. Dual-Site Deployment Strategy

### 7.1 Build Configuration

**Workspace Cargo.toml:**
```toml
[workspace]
resolver = "2"
members = [
    "crates/*",
    "apps/agentpdf-web/wasm",
    "apps/docsign-web/wasm",
    "apps/docsign-web/worker",
    "apps/corpus-api",
    "apps/mcp-server",
]

[workspace.dependencies]
# Unified versions across all crates
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
anyhow = "1"
thiserror = "1"
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
web-sys = "0.3"
lopdf = "0.33"
axum = "0.7"
```

### 7.2 CI/CD Pipeline

**.github/workflows/deploy.yml:**
```yaml
name: Deploy Sites

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      site:
        description: 'Site to deploy'
        required: true
        default: 'both'
        type: choice
        options:
          - agentpdf
          - docsign
          - both

jobs:
  build-agentpdf:
    if: github.event.inputs.site != 'docsign'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install wasm-pack
        run: curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

      - name: Build WASM
        run: |
          cd apps/agentpdf-web/wasm
          wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ../www/pkg

      - name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
        uses: cloudflare/pages-action@v1
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
          accountId: ${{ secrets.CF_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          projectName: agentpdf-org
          directory: apps/agentpdf-web/www

  build-docsign:
    if: github.event.inputs.site != 'agentpdf'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install wasm-pack
        run: curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

          npx wrangler deploy
        env:
          CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
```

### 7.3 Local Development

**Using Trunk (Recommended):**
```bash
# Install trunk once
cargo install trunk

# Development servers (auto-builds WASM with hot reload)
cd apps/agentpdf-web && trunk serve www/index.html --port 8080
cd apps/docsign-web && trunk serve www/index.html --port 8081

# Production builds
cd apps/agentpdf-web && trunk build www/index.html --release  # Output: www/dist/
cd apps/docsign-web && trunk build www/index.html --release   # Output: www/dist/
```

**Makefile:**
```makefile
.PHONY: dev-agentpdf dev-docsign test build

# Development servers (Trunk handles WASM build + hot reload)
dev-agentpdf:
	cd apps/agentpdf-web && trunk serve www/index.html --port 8080

dev-docsign:
	cd apps/docsign-web && trunk serve www/index.html --port 8081

# Testing
test:
	cargo test --workspace --all-features

test-agentpdf:
	cargo test -p agentpdf-wasm

test-docsign:
	cargo test -p docsign-wasm

# Production builds
build:
	cargo build --workspace --release
	cd apps/agentpdf-web && trunk build www/index.html --release
	cd apps/docsign-web && trunk build www/index.html --release
```

## 8. Phase 0: ASAP Deployment

**Goal:** Get working versions deployed to both domains within days, not weeks.

**Strategy:** Copy existing microservices with minimal modifications.

### Strategic Alignment (from [STRATEGY.md](./STRATEGY.md))

Phase 0 aligns with **Florida Real Estate Dogfooding**—launching first to landlords and property managers:

| Strategic Priority | Phase 0 Action | Why First |
|--------------------|----------------|-----------|
| § 83.512 Flood Disclosure | Add Flood Disclosure Wizard to agentPDF.org | Regulatory urgency creates demand |
| HB 615 Email Consent | Hardcode consent checkbox in signature flow | Cost savings pitch to property managers |
| 30-Day Termination | Update templates (already in existing code) | Templates already in corpus |
| Offline-First Moat | Preserve existing IndexedDB architecture | Foundation for all verticals |

> **Dogfooding Strategy:** The corpus already contains Florida residential lease templates and related documents. Targeting this vertical first validates the product with a focused user persona before expanding to healthcare and legal field operations.

### 8.0.1 agentPDF.org - Immediate Deployment

The existing `agentPDF-web` is **already deployable**. Steps:

1. Copy `agentPDF-web/www/` to `apps/agentpdf-web/www/`
2. Copy WASM crate with dependencies
3. Build and deploy

```bash
# Quick deploy script
cd apps/agentpdf-web

# Build with Trunk (handles WASM compilation automatically)
trunk build www/index.html --release

# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (output in www/dist/)
# Or use: ./scripts/deploy-agentpdf.sh
```

**Result:** agentPDF.org live with:
- PDF upload and viewing
- Florida compliance checking (10 rules)
- Field placement
- IndexedDB storage

**Florida RE Dogfooding Enhancements** (short-term priority):
- § 83.512 Flood Disclosure Wizard (interview-based form generation)
- HB 615 Email Consent checkbox (digitally verifiable audit trail)
- Updated 30-day termination language in templates
- Target users: Florida landlords, property managers, real estate agents

### 8.0.2 getsignatures.org - Immediate Deployment

The existing `docsign-web` is **already deployable**. Steps:

1. Copy `docsign-web/www/` to `apps/docsign-web/www/`
2. Copy WASM crate and worker
3. Build and deploy

```bash
# Quick deploy script
cd apps/docsign-web

# Build with Trunk (handles WASM compilation automatically)
trunk build www/index.html --release

# Deploy worker
cd worker && npx wrangler deploy

# Deploy static site to Cloudflare Pages (output in www/dist/)
# Or use: ./scripts/deploy-docsign.sh
```

**Result:** getsignatures.org live with:
- 4-step signing wizard
- PDF upload
- Recipient management
- PAdES digital signatures
- Email dispatch via Cloudflare Worker

**Field Ops Mode Enhancements** (medium-term, after Florida RE validation):
- GPS/photo evidence capture for process servers
- Medical Mode with HIPAA-compliant local encryption
- Offline-first sync for rural healthcare
- Target users: Mobile notaries, visiting nurses, process servers

### 8.0.3 Handoff Link

Add redirect from agentPDF.org to getsignatures.org:

```javascript
// apps/agentpdf-web/www/js/docsign-handoff.js
export function sendForSignatures(pdfBytes, filename) {
    const pdfBase64 = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...pdfBytes));
    const url = `https://getsignatures.org/#doc=${encodeURIComponent(pdfBase64)}&name=${encodeURIComponent(filename)}&source=agentpdf`;
    window.location.href = url;
}
```

---

## 9. Phase 1: Shared Foundation

**Timeline:** After Phase 0 deployment
**Goal:** Extract shared crates without breaking deployed sites

### 9.1 Create shared-types

```bash
mkdir -p crates/shared-types/src
```

**crates/shared-types/Cargo.toml:**
```toml
[package]
name = "shared-types"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
serde = { workspace = true }
```

**crates/shared-types/src/lib.rs:**
```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Document {
    pub id: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub metadata: DocumentMetadata,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct DocumentMetadata {
    pub title: Option<String>,

### 9.2 Create shared-pdf

Extract coordinate transformation and PDF parsing:

```rust
// crates/shared-pdf/src/coords.rs
// Copied from docsign-web/docsign-wasm/src/coords.rs

/// Transforms coordinates between DOM pixels and PDF user space
pub struct CoordinateTransform {
    pdf_width: f64,
    pdf_height: f64,
    dom_width: f64,
    dom_height: f64,
    scale: f64,
}

impl CoordinateTransform {
    pub fn new(pdf_width: f64, pdf_height: f64, dom_width: f64, dom_height: f64) -> Self {
        let scale = dom_width / pdf_width;
        Self { pdf_width, pdf_height, dom_width, dom_height, scale }
    }

    pub fn dom_to_pdf(&self, x: f64, y: f64) -> (f64, f64) {
        (x / self.scale, self.pdf_height - (y / self.scale))
    }

    pub fn pdf_to_dom(&self, x: f64, y: f64) -> (f64, f64) {
        (x * self.scale, (self.pdf_height - y) * self.scale)
    }
}
```

### 9.3 Update App Dependencies

Update `apps/agentpdf-web/wasm/Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
shared-types = { path = "../../../crates/shared-types" }
shared-pdf = { path = "../../../crates/shared-pdf" }
```

### 10.2 Implementation

```rust
// crates/compliance-engine/src/lib.rs
use shared_types::{ComplianceReport, Violation, Severity};

pub trait ComplianceRule: Send + Sync {
    fn id(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn statute(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn check(&self, text: &str) -> Vec<Violation>;
}

pub struct FloridaComplianceEngine {
    rules: Vec<Box<dyn ComplianceRule>>,
}

impl FloridaComplianceEngine {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            rules: vec![
                // From agentPDF-server
                Box::new(rules::RadonDisclosureRule),
                Box::new(rules::LeadPaintRule),
                Box::new(rules::BedBugRule),
                Box::new(rules::LateFeeRule),
                Box::new(rules::GracePeriodRule),
                Box::new(rules::AnomalyDetectionRule),

                // From agentPDF-web (preferred implementations)
                Box::new(rules::ProhibitedProvisionsRule),
                Box::new(rules::PropertyDisposalRule),
                Box::new(rules::AsIsWaiversRule),
                Box::new(rules::SecurityDepositRule::unified()),
                Box::new(rules::AttorneyFeesRule),
                Box::new(rules::NoticeRequirementsRule),
                Box::new(rules::MonthToMonthRule),
            ],
        }
    }

    pub fn check(&self, text: &str) -> ComplianceReport {
        let mut violations = Vec::new();
        let mut passed = 0;
        let mut failed = 0;
        let mut warnings = 0;

        for rule in &self.rules {
            let rule_violations = rule.check(text);
            if rule_violations.is_empty() {
                passed += 1;
            } else {
                for v in rule_violations {
                    match v.severity {
                        Severity::Critical | Severity::High => failed += 1,
                        Severity::Warning => warnings += 1,
                        _ => {}
                    }
                    violations.push(v);
                }
            }
        }

        ComplianceReport {
            document_id: String::new(),
            violations,
            passed,
            failed,
            warnings,
            checked_at: chrono::Utc::now().timestamp(),
        }
    }
}
```

### 10.3 Test Migration

Copy and merge all tests:

```bash
mkdir -p crates/compliance-engine/tests

# Copy agentPDF-web tests (90 tests)
cp ../microservices/agentPDF-web/agentpdf/crates/agentpdf-compliance/src/rules/*_test.rs \
   crates/compliance-engine/tests/

# Copy agentPDF-server verifier tests
cp ../microservices/agentPDF-server/tests/verifier_property_tests.rs \
   crates/compliance-engine/tests/
```

**Target:** 150+ tests after merging.

## 11. Phase 3: Full Integration

### 11.1 Template System Integration

Connect corpus templates to agentPDF.org:

```javascript
// apps/agentpdf-web/www/js/template-selector.js
const TEMPLATES = [
    { id: 'fl-lease-sf', name: 'Florida Single Family Lease', category: 'lease' },
    { id: 'fl-lease-mf', name: 'Florida Multifamily Lease', category: 'lease' },
    { id: 'fl-3day', name: '3-Day Notice (Non-Payment)', category: 'notice' },
    { id: 'fl-7day', name: '7-Day Notice (Violation)', category: 'notice' },
    { id: 'fl-30day', name: '30-Day Termination', category: 'notice' },
];

export function renderTemplateSelector(container) {
    // Render template cards
}

export async function loadTemplate(templateId) {
    // Fetch from corpus or embedded
}
```

### 11.2 Typst Rendering Integration

Add server-side rendering via corpus-api:

```rust
// apps/corpus-api/src/handlers/render.rs
use typst_engine::TypstEngine;

pub async fn render_template(
    State(engine): State<Arc<TypstEngine>>,
    Json(request): Json<RenderRequest>,
) -> Result<Json<RenderResponse>, AppError> {
    let pdf = engine.render(&request.template_id, &request.fields)?;
    Ok(Json(RenderResponse {
        pdf_base64: base64::encode(&pdf),
    }))
}
```

### 11.3 Cross-Site Deep Linking

Finalize handoff between sites:

```javascript
// apps/docsign-web/www/js/deep-link.js
export function parseIncomingDocument() {
    const hash = window.location.hash;
    if (hash.startsWith('#doc=')) {
        const params = new URLSearchParams(hash.slice(1));
        const docBase64 = params.get('doc');
        const filename = params.get('name') || 'document.pdf';
        const source = params.get('source');

        if (docBase64) {
            const bytes = Uint8Array.from(atob(docBase64), c => c.charCodeAt(0));
            loadDocumentFromBytes(bytes, filename);

            if (source === 'agentpdf') {
                showNotification('Document received from agentPDF.org');
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 14. Future Considerations

### 14.1 Tauri Desktop Application

The [RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md) proposes a Tauri desktop app. Once web deployment is stable:

```
apps/
├── agentpdf-web/          # Web version (current)
├── agentpdf-desktop/      # NEW: Tauri app
│   ├── src-tauri/
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   └── main.rs    # Tauri entry point
│   │   └── tauri.conf.json
│   └── src/               # Shared frontend
```

Benefits from Research:
- Single binary distribution
- Native performance
- Offline-first by default
- rspc for type-safe IPC

### 14.2 Sync & Multi-Device

From Research Phase 2-3:
1. Add Operation Log table (Event Sourcing)
2. Implement CRDT-based sync
3. Optional cloud sync for cross-device

### 14.3 MCP Server Integration

The `apps/mcp-server/` provides Claude Desktop integration:
- Template selection via natural language
- Compliance checking via conversation
- Document generation via MCP tools

Per [STRATEGY.md](./STRATEGY.md), MCP is positioned as **AI Infrastructure**:
- "Trojan Horse" strategy: bundle with getsignatures.org as differentiator
- First AI-Ready e-signature platform
- OAuth2 authentication for enterprise
- List on directories: Glama, Smith.ai, MCP.so

### 14.4 Government Micro-Purchase Strategy

Per [STRATEGY.md](./STRATEGY.md) Section 5, target federal micro-purchases (<$10K):

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Section 508 Compliance** | VPAT, screen reader support, keyboard nav |
| **Data Sovereignty** | Emphasize local-first, US-hosted |
| **SAM.gov Registration** | Keywords: "Disaster Response", "Rural Access" |
| **Pricing** | Annual license at $9,500 (under threshold) |

### 14.5 Vertical Mode Roadmap

Per [STRATEGY.md](./STRATEGY.md) Phase 2:

| Mode | Platform | Target Market | Key Features |
|------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Medical Mode** | getsignatures.org | Rural healthcare, visiting nurses | HIPAA encryption, EVV compliance, parking lot sync |
| **Field Ops Mode** | getsignatures.org | Process servers, mobile notaries | GPS stamping, photo evidence, evidentiary metadata |
| **Compliance Mode** | agentPDF.org | Florida landlords, property managers | Flood disclosure wizard, notice consent, template library |

---

## Summary

### Strategic Timeline (from [STRATEGY.md](./STRATEGY.md))

| Phase | Priority | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Florida RE Dogfooding** | Short-Term | Landlords, property managers, real estate agents |
| **Field Ops Pivot** | Medium-Term | Medical Mode + Field Ops Mode (after FL validation) |

5. **Add** § 83.512 Flood Disclosure Wizard to agentPDF.org
6. **Add** HB 615 Email Consent to signature flow
7. **Validate** with Florida landlords and property managers (dogfooding)

### Short-Term: Shared Foundation

8. **Extract** shared crates (shared-types, shared-pdf, shared-crypto)
9. **Unify** compliance engine with all 13 Florida rules
10. **Migrate** 243+ tests to monolith structure

### Medium-Term: Field Ops Pivot (after Florida RE validation)

11. **Integrate** template system from corpus-server
12. **Add** Typst rendering to agentPDF.org
13. **Implement** Medical Mode with HIPAA encryption
