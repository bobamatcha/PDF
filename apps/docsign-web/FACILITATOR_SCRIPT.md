# Facilitator Script for DocSign Usability Testing

**Purpose:** Word-for-word scripts for facilitators conducting usability tests with geriatric users (65+)

---

## Part 1: Introduction Script

### Welcome (Read exactly as written)

> "Hello [Participant Name], thank you so much for coming today. My name is [Your Name], and I'll be guiding you through this session.
>
> Before we start, I want you to know that there are no wrong answers or mistakes today. We're testing the application, not you. If something is confusing or difficult, that's the application's problem, not yours.
>
> Please feel free to take breaks whenever you need. Would you like some water before we begin?"

### Explain the Purpose

> "Today, we're going to look at a website that helps people sign documents electronically. You know how sometimes you need to sign papers at a doctor's office or for your bank? This application lets you do that on a computer instead.
>
> I'm going to ask you to complete some tasks while thinking out loud. This means telling me what you're thinking as you work. For example, 'I'm looking for a button to click' or 'I'm confused about what this means.'
>
> Your honest feedback will help us make this application better for people like you."

### Consent and Recording

> "Before we continue, I need to go over a few things:
>
> First, your participation is completely voluntary. You can stop at any time, for any reason, without any penalty.
>
> Second, with your permission, I'd like to record this session. The recording helps us remember exactly what happened. It will only be used by our team to improve the application. No one else will see it, and your name won't be attached to it.
>
> Do you give permission for me to record this session?
>
> [Wait for response. If No: That's completely fine. I'll just take written notes instead.]
>
> Do you have any questions before we begin?"

## Part 2: Background Questions

### Technology Comfort Assessment

> "I have a few quick questions to help me understand your experience with technology. There are no right or wrong answers.
>
> 1. How often do you use a computer or smartphone? Would you say daily, a few times a week, or less often?
>
> 2. What do you usually use your computer or phone for? For example, email, browsing websites, video calls with family?
>
> 3. Have you ever signed a document electronically before? This might have been through email or a website.
>
> [If yes:] How did that experience go for you?
>
> 4. Do you wear glasses when using a computer?
>
> 5. Is there anything about using a computer that you find particularly challenging?"

---

## Part 3: Task Instructions

### Before Each Task

> "I'm going to read you a task now. After I read it, please try to complete it on your own. Remember to tell me what you're thinking as you work. If you get stuck, that's okay - just let me know."

---

### Task 1: Opening the Signing Page

> **Read aloud:**
>
> "Imagine you received an email saying someone needs you to sign a document. The email has a link to click. I've put that link in front of you.
>
> Please click the link to open the signing page."

**What to observe:**
- Does the participant find and click the link easily?
- Any comments about loading time?
- Initial reaction to the page?

**If participant is stuck (after 1 minute):**
> "Take your time. Is there something that's unclear?"

**If still stuck (after 2 minutes):**
> "I see you're having some trouble. Let me point you to the link. [Point to screen]"

---

### Task 2: Reviewing Document Information

> **Read aloud:**
>
> "Good, the page has loaded. Before you sign anything, I'd like you to look at this page carefully.
>
> Can you tell me: Who sent this document to you? And what is the document called?"

**What to observe:**
- Can participant find sender name?
- Can participant find document name?
- Do they read the consent text?

**Probing questions if they struggle:**
> "Where would you look to find out who sent this?"
> "Is there anything on this page that tells you about the document?"

---

### Task 3: Viewing the Document

> **Read aloud:**
>
> "Now I'd like you to look at the actual document before signing it.
>
> Please find and click the button that lets you review the document."

**What to observe:**
- Do they find the "Review Document" button easily?
- Any hesitation about what to click?
- Reaction to seeing the document viewer?

**After document opens:**

- Can they navigate multiple pages?
- Do they notice the signature fields?

---

### Task 4: Drawing a Signature

> **Read aloud:**
>
> "Now let's sign the document. You'll notice there's a box on the document where your signature goes. It has a dotted blue border.
>

**What to observe:**
- Can they find the signature field?
- Do they understand how to draw?
- Quality of the drawn signature?
- Any motor control difficulties?
- Do they find the Apply button?

**If they struggle with drawing:**

---

### Task 5: Using the Typed Signature

> **Read aloud:**
>
> "Nice work! Now I'd like to show you another way to sign. Instead of drawing, you can type your name.
>
> Please find the option to type your signature instead of drawing it. Then type your name and choose a style you like."

**What to observe:**
- Can they find the Type tab?
- Do they understand the font selector?
- Can they see the preview?
- Do they successfully apply the typed signature?

**If they struggle to find Type option:**
> "Look at the top of the signature area. Do you see any tabs or options?"

### Task 6: Completing the Signing Process

>
> What do you see? Is there anything different on the screen now?"

**What to observe:**
- Do they notice the offline indicator?

## Appendix: Common Scenarios and Responses

### If participant becomes frustrated

> "I can see this is frustrating. Remember, if something is hard to use, that's helpful information for us. Would you like to take a short break, or should we move on to the next task?"

### If participant wants to quit

> "That's completely okay. Would you like to stop here? Before you go, is there anything specific that made you want to stop? That feedback would be very helpful."

### If participant asks for help

> "I understand you'd like help. Let me ask you first - what are you trying to do right now? [Listen to answer] What have you tried so far?"

[Only give direct help after at least two indirect prompts]

### If participant does something unexpected

> "That's interesting - I noticed you did [X]. Can you tell me why you chose to do it that way?"

### If technology fails

> "I apologize for this technical issue. This isn't your fault at all. Let me get this sorted out."

[Note the issue, fix if possible, or use backup device]

### If participant finishes very quickly

> "You finished that quickly! Can you walk me through what you just did and why it seemed straightforward to you?"
